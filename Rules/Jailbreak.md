Jailbreak is a game mode in which involves prisoners (Terrorists) and guards (Counter-Terrorists). The guard's aim is to kill any rebelling prisoners and order them to play games within the prison in order to get to a final prisoner. The prisoner's aim is to either survive by listening to the guard's orders or by rebelling and killing the remaining guards. The guards are run by a warden who is automatically selected at the beginning of each round. They are to govern the prison and give guards explicit orders which they must follow at all times.

1. ## Definitions
	1. Hunting: Actively looking for rebels away from the Warden.
	2. Freekill: If a guard kills a prisoner who was not rebelling.
	3. Rebelling: Rebelling is when a prisoner turns breaks any prisoner rules or whenever a prisoner is not following orders given by the warden.
	4. Walking: Either shift/crouch walking (no jumping).
	5. Shift: Whatever button you press to walk which is not crouching.
	6. Baiting: Coming within knifing distance of a prisoner or standing within the path of a moving transit of prisoners. If a prisoner knifes you from your baiting, you cannot retaliate.
	7. Ghosting: Ghosting is an act of multiple players handing out information to each other which results in an unfair gaming experience.
	8. Free time: An area restricted "free-day" where prisoners can freely move in (including jumping) and must follow the given restrictions for this free-time. (you cannot leave the area, you do not need to listen to any commands until free-time is revoked).
	9. Stairs / Ramp: This is the same thing.
	10. Bloodhound: The last prisoner trying to find the rebels for the guards to kill. There is no baiting during bloodhound and the guards may kill the bloodhound if they are purposely delaying.
	11. Rushing: Aggressively moving towards a guard who is not baiting.
	12. Restriction commands: A command that restricts prisoners from performing a certain action. E.g. Jumping.
	13. Nazi Day: A day when Guards can punish for minor errors. Can only be done when Guards are consistently struggling to control prisoners and the Warden has specified prior to opening cells that it will be a nazi day and explained what it is.
	14. AFK Freeze: not touching your keyboard or mouse and your character is standing still (not emoting or free-looking)
	15. Snitching: Telling the guards negative information about a fellow T, e.g. "Warden, Citizen has a gun" is snitching while "Warden, there's a gun in front of the marker" is not snitching.
	16. KOS: "Kill on sight". Being called KOS means when a guard sees a KOS person, they should kill the KOS person, usually for breaking a restriction or rebelling (Shown above).

2. ## Global Rules
	1. The general rules must always be followed.
	2. Honesty is key, please don't lie to staff about free-kills, etc.

	9. You cannot have any jailbreak related instructions in your name. (all T's, jump rope, freeze).
	10. The terms "Guards" and "Prisoners" will always refer to the corresponding teams, it cannot be changed, used in a trap, etc.. its an overriding name and should only be used for overriding confusing situations.
	11. If your microphone is bad do not use it, people might not understand what you’re saying particularly as the warden and it will cause complications.
	12. Unless you are part of the staff you cannot do microphone checks.
	13. The first round is always a programmed free day. Guards cannot give any orders excluding orders to drop guns, move away from a guard they are getting too close to, etc.
	14. Orders must be given and doors must be opened before 9:00 otherwise the plugin will automatically grant a free-day. If orders have not been given the Guard that opened the doors will be guard banned.
	15. The plugins are made for a reason, if the plugin prints it's a free day, it's a free day. (few exceptions).
	16. Cell doors should only be opened when the warden gives the command to do so or does it themselves (unless a rebelling T gets them open first).
	17. After cell doors have been opened, they should not be re-closed by anyone and remain open for the duration of the round.
	18. Shots must not be fired into a stack of prisoners unless the guard is certain they have a clear shot or if the stack is rebelling.
	19. Any incidents or rule-breaking that happens in one round cannot have an effect on any rounds after. For example, a prisoner has been free-killed in the round and requested a free day for the next round cannot be permitted.
	20. Vent cells are to be treated as normal cells if the vent is not accessible (closed off due to not being the random spawn).
	21. Do not ghost (bait someone's position out) especially if you’re dead.

	24. Free days are only allowed if requested in the LR menu or won through a mini-game.

3. ## Newcomer Rules
	1. Newcomer -- A Newcomer is a new player (with playtime less than 4 hours for a Prisoner, under 20 round wins for a Guard), whose playermodel is tinted green when not set to a different colour.
	2. If a Newcomer did not make it to the previous LR Partners stage, at least 1 newcomer must be kept alive until the LR Partners stage if possible.
	3. If a prisoner is given the choice to choose prisoners to live/die, at least ⅓ of the surviving prisoners must be Newcomers.
	4. Unless fully rebelling, Newcomers must always be warning shot instead of being KOS.
	5. Be considerate of newcomer Guards. Do not try and catch them on every little detail, but do feel free to inform them of any major mistakes they make.
	6. Do not excessively target newcomer guards as an easy rebel. They are there to learn and you constantly targeting them will discourage them from learning how to properly be a guard.

3. ## Rules for Prisoners
	1. All prisoners are considered rebels if they are seen to be trying to escape or rush/attack a guard. (with exceptions)
	2. Going past where the warden has told you to go/stop at high speed (e.g. bhopping/boosted) is classed as either running away or rushing if you are going towards a guard.
	2. Being in the armoury, a KOS zone, knifing or entering vents, shortcuts, and having a gun unholstered (in hand) instantly makes prisoners a rebel unless the warden has given permission to do so.
	3. Actively disobeying commands is classed as rebelling. This includes restriction commands.
	4. Orders take effect where you stand (when told to crouch walk follow warden don't jump first and then crouch walk, take 1 step out of your cell and freeze means not doing something else first).
	5. Wait until the warden has finished completing the order.
	6. Prisoners must follow the orders given by the warden until 20 seconds after their death (restrictions still apply).
	7. When given an order you try to complete it with the given restrictions (Unless specified all minigames CLEAR all movement restrictions). Should the minigame require you to ignore certain restrictions, the restriction will be lifted for the period of doing the minigame, and will re-apply after (unless specified otherwise).
	8. When given an order which you cannot complete (not including restrictions) you have to freeze.
	9. You have to actively participate in (map) mini-games (so you can't be just frozen and waiting).
	10. When a Warden is trying to sort out a game to run don't be an asshole and try and ruin it for them, be considerate and allow them time to do so.
	11. You're not allowed to use the !lr menu if you are the last prisoner alive and still in the process of completing a minigame or order.
	12. Prisoners are not allowed to be pardoned by a Warden if they are rebelling.
	13. If you do not have a microphone and you wish to talk you must AFK freeze and type your message then go back to following the commands.
	14. Toy guns are not allowed.
	15. Intentionally supplying a weapon to another T is counted as rebelling.
	16. Prisoners are allowed to snitch only if the warden has granted them permission, which they may request. You do not have to get permission to vouch against a snitch. Lying while snitching is KOS.
	17. On a free-day, camping outside of the armoury to trap guards inside will result in being warning-shot then made KOS.

4. ## Rules For Guards
	1. To be a guard you need to have a clear microphone and be willing to be a warden if selected (you can transfer warden as long as you do your fair share of wardening).
	2. Favouritism is not allowed in any form, other than giving consideration to Newcomers.
	3. Guards cannot enter the vents unless they are sure a prisoner has gone inside or is currently inside. (You do not have to follow the same entrance, so long as you do not break any other vent related rules)

	7. Guards are not allowed to give prisoners guns at any given point.
	8. Guards must give prisoners a fair chance to complete the warden's orders. Not doing so is classed as free killing.
	9. Warning shots must be given as much as possible by holding down "E" and shooting a prisoner for non-threatening actions. For example delaying, not facing the right direction, not crouching when told to do so, etc. Warning shots do not have to be given if a prisoner fails a mini-game, running away, is inside/hitting a vent, in a KOS area, blatantly disobeying orders, or not completing orders after a large amount of time.
	10. Guards should leave the armoury by 9:30 and can only return to the armoury if a prisoner is seen in the armoury or for a very prompt ammo restock.
	11. When there is only one rebelling prisoner remaining, guards are allowed to be sent by the warden to hunt any vents, secrets, and the prison.
	12. Guards can only attack rebelling prisoners. If you accidentally free shoot someone then you must heal them if requested. If you accidentally free kill someone you must revive them or kill yourself in the armoury.

	15. Guards should always be considerate of prisoners that may not have a microphone.
	16. Do not bait prisoners. This means coming within knifing distance, one step away from a prisoner, standing within the path of a moving transit of prisoners. If a prisoner knifes you from your baiting, you cannot retaliate.
	17. Guards are not allowed to shoot when the "lights out" on the black market is activated, and also are restricted from shooting through smoke unless it poses no risk to non-rebels.
	18. Guards cannot judge who is trying to escape a cell solely from the sound of vents breaking, they have to physically see a prisoner trying to escape to call KoS. Guards can use sound cues to hunt, as long as they follow previous rules regarding vents.
	19. Standing on top of a building (e.g. Medic or Armoury) is not classed as camping that area unless blocking an entrance.
	20. Once the last prisoner is choosing LR, CT's must run away and prepare to fight, if they ask you not to follow them.
	21. CT cannot lie about the Warden's commands. E.g. Where the marker is, what restrictions are in place or similar.
	22. You must actively hunt the last rebelling T, otherwise, it will be classed as delaying.

	25. All mini-games you make prisoners do must be explained in full. Asking the prisoners to crouch if they do not know how to play.
	26. Do not be a warden who punishes players for minor errors. This is only acceptable for Nazi days (see 6.13).
	27. Wardens are not allowed to consecutively do Nazi rounds. (E.g. 3-4 nazi rounds in a row).

	30. Wardens are not allowed to kill non-rebelling prisoners if there are 2 non-rebels left (e.g. don't decide who gets LR with bait commands, or custom restrictions). The only exception would be if a prisoner has to reach the end of a mini-game. (like deathrun where the only way out is the end).

	35. On jb_tropico Friendly Fire as a whole is not allowed due to the large player count in cells.
	36. Wardens may not make prisoners play deathball in a small area. The play area must have lots of space to dodge the ball. E.g. The cell medic on jb Peanut would be too small, but the cage outside would be big enough. You can't use Ticking Time Bomb to help target rebelling Ts.

6. ## Last Request/Special Day Rules
	1. During !lr you have the ability to specify your rules and conditions to your LR (with exceptions)

	3. Both parties of the LR must be ready before you start an LR.
	4. Whilst doing race, both parties must agree on a start and endpoint before they begin and the destinations must be chosen as quickly as possible to ensure there is no round delay.
	5. No glitching an LR so that one of the parties is stuck or is unable to take part fairly in an LR. This involves teleporting players to unfair places where if they win they may die or telling a guard to go to a place that puts you at an unfair advantage. This also means for special days such as war days, you cannot hold down a location that gives you a distinct advantage over the other team i.e. jb_clouds - Extreme climb teleporter or other map teleports
	6. Last Requests that require staff must be accepted by 3 parties: the player itself, the warden, and a staff member (missing 1 of the 3 implies you don't get your LR)
	7. Custom LRs are allowed if they are reasonable, do not take too long coming to an agreement and both the warden and prisoner has to come to an agreement
	8. Do not delay the round when LR becomes available to you. If you do you will be slain or made KOS
	9. Gun toss rules are to be set by the prisoner before the first gun is thrown and must be understood by the guard.
	10. Players cannot slay themselves or kill themselves if they do not like an LR game.
	11. Prisoners can still be classed as rebelling when they have access to LR. Being last alive is not a free pass to intimidate guards.
	12. Teaming is not allowed in special days except Hunger Games.
	13. You cannot start a typing contest with a player you know is gagged.
